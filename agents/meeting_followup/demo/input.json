  "transcript": "Maya: Our ERP and analytics stack are on-prem and we are hitting scaling limits. We want to move core workloads to AWS over the next 2 quarters.\nJordan: What does success look like?\nMaya: Cut batch processing time by 40% and reduce infra outages. Security is a gating item. We need SSO integration and encryption at rest. Also, we need a plan for data residency for EU customers.\nJordan: Who else is involved in the decision?\nMaya: I own the technical evaluation. Procurement will run the paper process. Our CIO signs off. I can loop in the security lead next week.\nJordan: What are the next steps?\nMaya: Send a high-level migration plan and an estimate. Also, confirm whether you support EU residency. We'll schedule a security review next Tuesday.\nJordan: Timeline?\nMaya: We want a proposal by Jan 10. If security review goes well, we can start the pilot in February."
